# üöÄ Deploying an NGINX Web Server on AWS EC2 with a Custom Domain using Cloudflare üåê

For this Networking module, I deployed my own NGINX web server on an AWS EC2 instance and connected it to a custom domain purchased through Cloudflare.

I‚Äôll walk you through every stage of the process: from buying the domain to setting up DNS records, configuring the server, and customising the landing page.

## Stage 1 ‚Äì Purchased a Domain

I bought a domain using **Cloudflare** to use for my NGINX web server project.

**Steps:**
1. Logged into Cloudflare.
2. Purchased a new domain name.
3. Prepared it for linking to my server later.

## Stage 2 ‚Äì Launched EC2 Instance and Installed NGINX

I set up an AWS EC2 instance and installed NGINX to serve web content.

**Steps:**
1. Opened AWS EC2 dashboard.
2. Launched a new instance using Amazon Linux 2.
3. Selected t2.micro (free tier) instance type.
4.  Configured security group rules to allow inbound HTTP (port 80) from 0.0.0.0/0.
5. Connected using AWS EC2 Instance Connect in the browser.
6. Installed NGINX by running these commands:

   ```bash
   sudo yum -y install nginx
   sudo systemctl start nginx
   sudo systemctl enable nginx

7. I then confirmed if nginx was running :
 
    ```bash
    systemctl status nginx

## Stage 3 ‚Äì Linked DNS to EC2 Instance

I connected my Cloudflare domain to the EC2 instance so the site could be reached via the domain name

**Steps:**
1. Logged into Cloudflare and opened the DNS settings.
2. Added an **A record**:
   - Name: @
   - IPv4 address: EC2 public IPv4
   - Proxy status: DNS only
3. Waited a short time for the DNS changes to take effect

## Stage 4 ‚Äì Verified DNS and Connectivity

I checked that the domain points to my EC2 and that it‚Äôs reachable.

**Steps:**
1. Looked up the A record:
   ```bash
   nslookup http://nginxjawwad.org/
   # or for a shorter version
   dig +short http://nginxjawwad.org/

2. Tested basic connectivity:

  ```bash
  ping  http://nginxjawwad.org/

3. Opened the domain in a browser to confirm the NGINX page loads.
